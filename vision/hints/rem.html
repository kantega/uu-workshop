    If you set the font size using pixels, the website won't scale with the
    user's font size settings. However, if you use rem, it will follow it. 1 rem
    is equivalent to the font size the user has set. The default is 16px, so you
    can divide your pixel sizes by 16 to get what they should be in rem.
