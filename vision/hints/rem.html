    If you set the font size using pixels, the website won't scale with the
    user's font size settings. However, if you use rem, it will follow it.
    <code>1rem</code> is equivalent to the font size the user has set. The
    default is <code>16px</code>, so you can divide your pixel sizes by 16 to
    get what they should be in rem.
