      One cannot rely solely on color to convey information. Text or icons
      should also be used for explanation. Perhaps you could change the mouse
      pointer to 'not-allowed'? By setting <code>cursor: not-allowed</code> on
      <code>button:disabled</code> in the CSS, the mouse pointer will change
      when hovering over a disabled button.

      With a bit more work, you could make the tooltip display an error message
      when hovering over the button - "You must enter an email address to
      submit". But this is a lot of effort for a solution that is still not
      universally designed, as a screen reader will not be able to highlight a
      disabled button and will therefore never display the error message. What
      you should do is to let the button remain enabled, but display the error
      message when it is clicked.
