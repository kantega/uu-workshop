      Does readability really improve if absolutely everything grows when the
      font size grows?
    </p>
    <p>
      If the side margins grow, there will only be room for less text per line.
      Therefore, side margins/padding should be specified in pixels, and
      top/bottom margins/padding in rem.

    <p>
      Another alternative is to change the media queries to use rem instead of
      px, so that you get mobile view on large screens if you have a large font
      size.
