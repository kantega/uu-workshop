    Forms have a lot of built-in functionality. If you turn the content of the
    modal into a form, add <code>required</code> to the input fields, and change
    the email field to <code>type="email"</code>, you can skip custom validation
    and just use the browser's built-in validation.

    <p>
      However, it should be noted that this doesn't always align well with the
      design, but it's at least an option.
