    The first thing you need to do is to inform the screen reader that you are
    in a modal. This can be done either by replacing the
    <code>div</code> with the <code>dialog</code> element, or by giving the
    <code>div</code> a role attribute: <code>role="dialog"</code>. If you then
    open the dialog, you will have the opportunity to read the contents of the
    modal, as the screen reader knows what is part of the open content.
    Additionally, if you add <code>aria-labelledby="modal-header"</code>, the
    screen reader will read the label before starting to read the input field.
    You can also use <code>aria-describedby</code> if there is some kind of
    introduction in the modal.
