    A screen reader reads all elements when the page loads, so it does not pick
    up if an element suddenly appears, as often happens with error messages.
    Aria-live is an attribute you can add to elements that may change.
    <code>aria-live="polite"</code> will make the screen reader announce the
    error message when it occurs.
